 ## About me 🧬
I work in offensive security, focusing on breaking real systems and understanding where complex architectures fail in practice. Most of my work is around web applications and APIs, but I also spend a lot of time testing cloud environments and exploring security issues in AI systems. I'm especially interested in vulnerability research and source-code-driven testing.
